This datepicker is an extension to the jQuery UI's datepicker. While jQuery UI datepicker allows the user to select a calendar date, this allows user to choose an approximated time period like 3 days or 2 weeks.

### Getting Started
*On clicking the input field in the index page, the regular jQuery UI datepicker opens.
*You can then choose to click on the approximately tab to open the Approximate Datepicker

### Prerequisites
Have the jQuery UI library added to the project.
